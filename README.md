### Undergraduate Education:

Let me explain a little about my intuition. Throughout years I attended public schools for my undergrad or grad school, I noticed that online and on campus education platforms and instituition touches the surface of a concept due to time constraint. All the instructors correctly advise you to do further reading to gain more in depth knowledge, but there are times where you don't know how much more you should gain ? There have been attemp to test of understanding of the material through completetion of projects, passing quizes , or exams. But with the arrival of AI and GPT models, even surface understanding of a concept should be enough for you to complete a project. This is where us, human, are getting behind the speed of AI evolution. We need to form a new way of evaluating our understanding , also increase the slope of our learning curve.
